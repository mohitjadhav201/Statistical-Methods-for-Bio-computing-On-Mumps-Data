# Statistical Methods for Bio-computing on Mumps Data

Welcome to the repository for the project "Statistical Methods for Bio-computing on Mumps Data." In this project, we explore the application of statistical methods to analyze and interpret Mumps data in the field of bio-computing. This README provides an overview of the project, the data used, the steps taken, and the methodologies applied.

## 📊 Data

The dataset used in this project contains Mumps-related data:
## Hepatitis B Virus Sequences

From the given database of sequences, we have selected ten sequences of the Hepatitis B virus with the following accession numbers:

1. AD90231
2. AD00663
3. CX63709
4. CY08214
5. DAF142766
6. DAF142769
7. FZ77158
8. FZ77160
9. KAF365891
10. MEU069917

These 10 sequences are DNA sequences consisting of 4 nucleotides:
- Adenine (A)
- Guanine (G)
- Cytosine (C)
- Thymine (T)

etc.

## 📝 Steps

Our project unfolds through the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and clean the Mumps data to make it suitable for statistical analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.

3. **Statistical Modeling:** Apply various statistical methods like [list statistical methods] to analyze the Mumps data and extract meaningful insights.

4. **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulate and test hypotheses related to the Mumps data to validate or refute specific claims.

5. **Results Interpretation:** Interpret the results of statistical analyses to draw conclusions and make informed decisions in the context of bio-computing and Mumps research.
